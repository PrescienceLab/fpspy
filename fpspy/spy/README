Preload library for floating point exception interception and
statistics gathering.

Please see the comment in fpe_preload.c for some details of how this 
works and what it illustrates.

To build:

   make


To test:

   make test

The code has two modes of operation:

- Aggregate mode simply captures the floating point exception state
  at the beginning and end of the program.  Since the exception state
  is sticky, this will let us know if the program had 1 or more 
  occurances of each of the possible exceptions
- Individual mode captures individual floating point exceptions, 
  emulating the instructions that cause them (NOT COMPLETE)
